# 2020TransgenerationalPhenotyping_Evolution
Data and scripts for Alvarez, et al. 2020, Evolution

Phenovern.combined.new.csv contains the original, raw data for both generations (2 and 3) of the experiment.

GerminationData_Phenovern.csv contains germination data for both generations (2 and 3). This is a separate file because germination data had an additional treatment, which was a manipulation of the germination environment.


Scripts to analyse the raw data are contained in the GenerationComparisonV6.R file. Analyses are organized within functions, but file calls are hard coded. Sorry about that - just check for the setwd() function.


All figures were produced with the VisualizationsV8.R script.
